Experience
----------

**Senior Developer - Summit ESP (March 2018 to present)**

* Member of team implementing a caching and communications middleware api for SAP integration of an in-house inventory, sales, and workflow application with parent company. The application and the integration solution are both in Python and Django. The application front-end, which I worked on briefly, uses AngularJS.

**Senior Mobile App Developer - JoCo (September 2017 to January 2018)**

Contract staffing, working on an internal Telerik AppBuilder application
for an oil and gas pipeline company.

* In three months, I was able to knock out most of a six month backlog of bugs and feature requests.

* While adding features and improving maintainability, I reduced the codebase's LOC by approximately five thousand lines.

* I assisted in migration away from Telerik Platform, which was shutting down, to a locally managed build and deploy solution.

**Self-Paid Sabbatical (March 2017 to September 2017)**

A period of rest and relaxation after accepting early retirement from
HCSC. Not strictly the sort of thing to list on a resumé as experience,
but I recommend that everyone take one if given the chance.

**Senior Mobile Application Developer - HCSC (June 1998 to February 2017)**

In just shy of twenty years with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma
(later merged with HCSC), I worked in IT roles ranging from operator to
systems administrator to applications developer. I consider all of those
roles as having expanded my tool set.

* I was the sole developer on the first three versions of the flagship
		Android and iOS apps for BCBS of Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, New
		Mexico, and Montana, all of which were Cordova/Phonegap
		applications.

* More recently, I was a member of the joint HCSC/Pivotal Labs XP team
		developing the fourth generation of those apps, complete re-writes
		in native Java and Swift, which have been released to the app stores
		(iOS in Nov 2016, and Android in Feb 2017).

Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **JavaScript:** Probably the language in which I've written the most
code, although unfortunately in environments that prevented the use of
ES6. Still, I've written web page interactions, Cordova applications
(some ported from native Objective C and Java apps), and a custom
command line build system that helped manage the build and deployment to
give separate Blue Cross Blue Shield state plans their own, properly
branded and configured, versions of a basic iOS and Android app that
served as the base of them all.

:   **Swift:** My last year with HCSC was spent on a joint HCSC/Pivotal
team porting the flagship Cordova app (see above) back to native. I was
then primary engineer on the migration of the app from Swift 2.3 to
Swift 3. I love this language and haven't gotten to spend nearly as much time with it as I would like to.

:   **Java:** I've kept familiar with it since back when Java In A
Nutshell fit in one, fairly thin, book. I've done Android work in Java,
as well as backend work involving both web application and web services
(both SOAP and REST).

:   **So Many Others** I'm a generalist, and have basic knowledge of more languages than I could list here, although I did make [a list of the ones I'd been paid for](http://codelahoma.tumblr.com/post/121463281286/programming-and-markup-languages-ive-written-on) once upon a time. Basically, if it's not Prolog or a deliberately obtuse language like Brainf*ck, I can get up to speed quickly. I'm especially interested in the modern JVM languages like Kotlin, Clojure, and Scala.

Dev in the House of Ops

:   In my previous life  as a system admin, I had a chance to work on some
solo projects that provided business value.

	* I wrote a secure alternative to `more` and `pg` (both of which
	allow shell escapes) in `awk`. This script was used throughout my
	subsidiary's custom Universe/SB+ applications to close a security
	gap created by the insecure permissions scheme required by Universe
	at the time.

	* I created a change management system for my subsidiary using an
	ad-hoc object storage and retrieval system I wrote in ksh93. The
	system isolated the developers from production, and allowed code
	review and promotion to production only by authorized users.

	* Wrote a Perl program to convert monthly reports to PDFs, which could
	then be stored on CD-ROM, eliminating over $5K monthly spend on
	micro-fiche conversion, speeding turnaround, and improving
	searchability.

Open Source
:   I love open source software, and have contributed to, among others, [Firefox iOS](https://github.com/codelahoma/firefox-ios/graphs/contributors), [Browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify/graphs/contributors), and [Coffeescript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/graphs/contributors),
as well corrections to documentation whenever I spot a typo or incorrect
statement on Github, since they make it so easy to fork and submit a
pull request within the web interface.
